MIDI Controller for Soundcraft Uixx

The aim of this project is to create a MIDI controller for Soundcraft Ui mixing console.
It doesn't currently support MIDI control.
The controller would connect the MIDI device (control surface) to the Ui console and translate the MIDI commands to the native commands or the opposite way, depending on the settings.
The user can configure the rules to transform.
